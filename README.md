Observations from the weather vs latitude analysis

1 - Unsurprisingly, there was a strong correlation between latitude and max temperature.  The closer to 0 latitude the higher the max temperature got.  The farther away, the colder.  This was true for both the northern and southern hemispheres.

2 - More surprising was that humidity did not show the same trend.  Humidity was much less correlated to the latitude then was temperature.  High humidity readings were recorded up to the highest latitudes.

3 - Cloudiness and wind speed showed no correlation to latitude.  These reading were spread evenly across all latitudes.
